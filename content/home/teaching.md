Though my main appointment is at the National Marine Fisheries Service, I do get
to teach a bit.  Lately I have been teaching full-length courses or seminars
in reproducible research methods and data analysis to colleagues and ecology students.
I also get to guest lecture occasionally.  

**Quarter-courses:**

- [Case studies in Reproducible Research](https://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-eeb-2017/).  Weekly seminar (a UCSC
EEB 295 course). Spring 2017.
- [Reproducible Research Course](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/). Taught at the SWFSC to about 50
students comprised of NMFS colleagues, UCSC graduate students, MBARI employees, and a handful of students from
Pacific Collegiate School (a local high school).  Tu and Th for 10 weeks.  Fall 2014.
- [AMS 291: Applications of Bayesian Nonparametric Methods in Statistical Genetics](https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/ams291/Spring10/) A quarter-long advanced graduate seminar in the
Applied Math and Statistics Department at UCSC.  Spring 2010.

**Recent Guest Lectures**

- UCSC. Math 115. Graph Theory. Gave a guest lecture to Richard Montgomery's Graph Theory course about
applications of graphs in statistical inference in genetics. You can download my
[slides](https://github.com/eriqande/graph-theory-guest-lecture-feb-2016/blob/master/tex/graphs-in-statistics-slides.pdf) 
and also the accompanying 
[narrative](https://github.com/eriqande/graph-theory-guest-lecture-feb-2016/blob/master/tex/graphs-in-statistics-narrative.pdf) 
from GitHub. Winter 2016.

    - [R-code Companions](http://eriqande.github.io/sisg_mcmc_course/): we have started putting together a number of
    R notebooks that serve as R-code based implementaions to illustrate points from several sections in the lectures.

# Biography

Eric C. Anderson is a statistical geneticist focused on the application of molecular technologies to 
fisheries management and ecological research.  I have worked extensively in the application of single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to Pacific salmon fishery management and research.  Recently I have been involved in the development of novel next-generation sequencing approaches for conservation
genetics.

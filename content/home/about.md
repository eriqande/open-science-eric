# Biography

Eric C. Anderson is a statistical geneticist focused on the application of molecular technologies to 
ecological research and fisheries management.  He has worked extensively in the application of single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to Pacific salmon fishery management and research.  Recently,
with his colleagues in the Molecular Ecology and Genetic Analysis (MEGA) team at the Southwest Fisheries
Science Center, he 
has been promoting the development of novel, next-generation sequencing methods for conservation
genetics, implementing bioinformatic and statistical approaches to make the methods 
broadly applicable.  He 
also contributes to the [Bird Genoscape Project](http://www.birdgenoscape.org/), which his wife co-directs,
and collaborates widely with molecular ecologists, conservation geneticists, and fishery biologists.

Eric is an active proponent of reproducible research and open science.  You can find
that many of his ongoing research projects are developed in the open, publicly, on GitHub.
He has also taught courses (in [2014](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/) and 
[2017](https://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-eeb-2017/)) in reproducible research using R,
RStudio, and GitHub to his colleagues at
NMFS, and to students and affiliated researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

abstract = "We develop a procedure to reliably score tetraploid genotypes of green sturgeon using Fluidigm SNP assays. Individual alleles cannot always be resolved, but genotype categories can be.  We show how such categories can be used for population assignment, inference of population structure, and individual identification."

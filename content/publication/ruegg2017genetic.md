abstract = "We develop a novel, yet simple, Bayesian approach to combine genetic data with stable isotope data and use habitat suitability inferred from eBird occurrence data.  The method is implemented in the R package gaiah, available from CRAN.  We use gaiah to infer the breeding location of migratory Wilson's Warblers.  "
